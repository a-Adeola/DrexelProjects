LOCATION OF SAMPLE FILES:
-Survey files were stored in the directory named Surveys(Homework2/Surveys)
-Test files were stored in the directory named Tests  (Homework2/Tests)
-Response files were stored in the directory named Responses (Homework2/Responses)
 the correct answer files are also stored here and all end with "-correctAnswer"

MULTIPLE RESPONSES:
Users have the option to choose how many responses the survey or test taker can enter.
The number of responses has to be greater than 0.
For multiple choice, the no. of responses has to be > 0 and < no. of choices.

Multiple responses was implemented for the following question types:
-multiple choice
-essay
-short answer
-valid date

Not implemented for:
-True False questions

Other:
Matching accepts an exact number of responses that is needed to match the left and right
columns. So it allows multiple responses, but it is fixed based on the options.

SURVEY MENU
Create, display, load, save, take,tabulate and modify menus were made.
Serialization was used for survey loading and saving.

TEST MENU
Create, display, display with answers, load, save, take, tabulate, grade and modify menus were made.
Serialization was used for test loading and saving.


TABULATE
After a Survey or Test is taken, it needs to be saved for the tabulated data to be stored after the program is terminated.
I could have done this manually by doing a Test.serialize(loadedTest) or Survey.serialize(loadedSurvey) after tabulating or returning to the
main menu, but I felt it would be better to have the user actually save it themselves.

LOAD
A response can be loaded ONLY when the selection is a Test.
The load menu checks to ensure that the response loaded is for the right test, so a test's response cannot be loaded for a different test.
