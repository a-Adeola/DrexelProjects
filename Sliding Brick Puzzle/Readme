My SBP is contained in a class, BrickPuzzle. 

My node class is used to represent the different states of the Brick Puzzle. 
The loadGame method takes in the given text file, reads the file, sets the width and height, then the remaining input is read then passed to the createGrid method. 
The createGrid method takes the given input, and creates the matrix/game state. 
The game state is then passed to the requested search function. 

The heuristic I used for Astar was the manhattan heuristic.
Regarding the space time complexity for my algorithms, A* is the slowest, then BFS, IDS, then DFS.

The several methods of the class cover the required functionality provided in the assignment instructions.
